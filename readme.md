# Automated DFT & High-Throughput Simulations  
## Quantum ESPRESSO with PWTK — Hands-on Workshop Materials

This repository contains the **hands-on materials, example input files, and automation scripts**
used in the **MetaChem Academy workshop**:

> **Automated DFT & High-Throughput Simulations**  
> *Mastering Quantum ESPRESSO with PWTK*  
> **Dec 15–17, 2025 | Online (Live + Recordings)**

The focus of this workshop is **practical automation** — moving from
manual `pw.x` runs to **scripted, reproducible, and scalable DFT workflows**
using **PWTK**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repo is designed to help participants:

- Understand the **difference between manual `pw.x` workflows and PWTK**
- Learn **automation-first thinking** for DFT
- Perform **geometry optimization** using reusable scripts
- Prepare a foundation for **high-throughput simulations**
- Keep all workshop examples **simple, transparent, and modifiable**

All files here are meant to be **edited, broken, rerun, and reused**.

## 📅 Workshop Content Overview

### 🔹 Day 1 — Foundations
- Linux & Vim basics for computational work
- Quantum ESPRESSO overview
- Installation and environment setup
- Understanding QE input file structure

### 🔹 Day 2 — Automation with PWTK
- Manual `pw.x` vs automated PWTK workflows
- Geometry optimization examples
- Writing reusable PWTK scripts
- Job execution and basic workflow management

---

## 📂 What’s Inside (Conceptual Overview)

### **Day 1**
- Installation scripts for Quantum ESPRESSO
- Introductory PDFs for Linux, Vim, and QE basics

### **Day 2**
- Side-by-side comparison of:
  - Manual `pw.x` execution
  - PWTK-based automation
- Silicon (Si) optimization examples
- Copper (Cu) optimization example
- Simple job helper scripts

Each example is intentionally **small and focused**, so the logic of automation
is easy to follow.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone or download the repo**
2. Start with **Day 1 materials** if you are new to:
   - Linux
   - Vim
   - Quantum ESPRESSO
3. Move to **Day 2 examples** and:
   - Run the `pw.x` inputs manually
   - Then run the equivalent PWTK scripts
4. Compare:
   - Input complexity
   - Reproducibility
   - Ease of scaling

The goal is not speed — it is **clarity and good habits**.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Density Functional Theory (DFT)
- Linux or macOS environment (recommended)
- Quantum ESPRESSO installed
- PWTK installed

Minimum system requirements:
- **8 GB RAM**
- **~20 GB free disk space**

## 🧠 How to Learn Best from This Repo

- Read input files **line by line**
- Modify lattice constants, cutoffs, k-points
- Break scripts intentionally and fix them
- Re-run the same example for a different material
- Focus on *why automation helps*, not just how

This is **research training**, not a black-box tutorial.

- MSc & PhD students
- Postdoctoral researchers
- Faculty members
- Computational chemistry & materials science researchers
- Anyone planning **large or repetitive DFT studies**

---


## 📜 Usage & License

- Free to use for **educational and academic research**
